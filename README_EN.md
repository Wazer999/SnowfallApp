SnowfallApp
=========================

A visual enhancement for Windows that displays snowfall on the screen.

# Download

1. Download the [latest version of the program from the Releases page](https://github.com/Wazer999/SnowfallApp/Releases) of this repository as an exe file.
2. Open the exe file.

The program does not require installation and works in portable mode.

# How to Use

* When the program starts, you will be asked to choose your preferred language.
* Click on the window if it is not selected as active in the system.
* Press the corresponding key on your keyboard (1 for English, 2 for Russian).
* Press the number 1 key on your keyboard to toggle snowfall on or off.
* You can configure the snowfall by opening the settings corresponding to the numbers displayed on the keyboard. These options will be shown on the screen.
* To exit the program, simply close the console by clicking the "X" button in the upper-left corner of the window.

# Note

The program is still in Beta testing and has not been fully tested.
It may work inconsistently in fullscreen windows. Before launching fullscreen applications, it is recommended to disable snowfall and re-enable it after the application starts. If snowfall does not display in fullscreen mode, try restarting SnowfallApp (this may help in rare cases).
